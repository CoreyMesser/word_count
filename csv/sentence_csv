179,"White female, of approximate height and weight of the victim in question, time of death roughly estimated to a day after the kidnaping",1
180,It all culminated in a flash and shock that shook the small home and caused every dog within the city to utter a low long howl of sadness,1
181,The good doctor came in high acclaim in the few short years after he appeared on the scene,1
182,Torn down and ground into the dirt the home was treated like a cancer and the lot cut from the street down to the bedrock a week later,1

184,I cannot say I have seen more selfless people then these two old farmers,1
185,His parting letter stated simply that he so understood that he had no fear shedding his mortal coil to be with his boy,1
186,The single icy eye rarely left my face and hands as I took the bandages from around her head,1
187,"So convincing was her point, the attendees looked wistfully at the doors of the conference room, as if anxious to leave and attempt to test this adolescent theory",1
188,He mind was growing so fast that she had conquered over half of my vast library,1

191,Heather arrived quietly as I was unfolding the thick waxy paper from the contents,1
192,In the few years that had spanned Bernard’s downfall I had acquired three merchant ships and outfitted them as research vessels that I often employed,1

198,"The girl, he claims was standing, limbs limp, facing the embers",1
199,"The world seems to be receding, cresting waves after a magnificent swell",1
200,Thank the theologian’s God for Marta my maid; I must remember to raise her pay again,1
201,Stains of red peaked out from her stained white hair where the new bandages had failed to cover it,1
202,Here farmer Howard found more than he was indeed looking for,1
203,"Before the unrest upon the Board could turn to an outright riot Heather Rose Post Gardener, Gardener being my last name she took when officially adopted, stood and raised her hand for silence",1
204,"Not as common as the first year of day-to-day greetings, but now a week to week",1
205,I came and went more often now that the child was alone checking on her wellbeing and safety,1
206,I have recorded well off the charts in almost all areas of knowledge,1
207,I could not remember the last time I had seen her outside,1
208,Abraham’s letters were routed through a shell address in town and then forwarded to my address to keep Heather’s persona secret,1
209,Horrifying as the grotesque stitches were they were no match for the stitches that encircled her left eye,1
210,The skinny cow had wandered out into the flat snow dusted field to try to find something in the stubble that was left,1
211,For three weeks all was silent,1
212,"Here however, a more delicate touch was required then that of the field",1
213,"To discuss, debate, and act on a panel of judges over a large range of subjects",1
214,It was not a matter of reading a book a few times to do apply the garnered information to research,1
215,Never had science stroked the scandal with drama such as this,1
216,For one day we saw Bernard exit his study as his little boy’s body was burned upon orders from the doctor,1
217,"Years had we spent as brothers in arms, until we eventually became what we were not in genetics, but in heart, brothers",1
218,"The conference ended shortly after, only a few questions asked after the evidence of a soul speech",1
219,But upon further inspection I found the day to be dark and dreary with no wind or rain,1
220,The one time I was able to see inside I was astonished at the amount of paper stacked in the corners of the room and upon the shelves,1
221,I know she has never made such claims but they were spread about freely as if she were screaming them from the rooftops,1
222,"They both reacted in surprise, the farmer Howard from the chilling feeling in his fingertips, and the girl as she seemed to snap back to reality",1
223,As we knocked upon the door the birds screaming rose as did the screams from inside the home until we were all covering our ears,1
224,Yet in the age of steam and steel he was ridiculed for his theories on the existence of a life source and the being of soul,1
225,They knew of Dr,1
226,Forced to live upon what small coin and scraps her mother could bring in as a seamstress struggling was no stranger,1
227,"By Corey Messer
",1
228,The darkness of night consumed by the small storm blowing the snow in curtains,1
229,Our eyes fell upon a great book twenty inches in length least four that wide and a great six solid inches in sheer pages least the covers,1
230,"Tiny as they were and precise as if laid by a skilled hand, an irregular oval of stitches encircled her eye and eyebrow as if someone had taken it out and replaced it with another",1
231,Mostly composed of questions or praise for her work with the occasional scathing letter from some bruised ego,1
232,When her song ended she fell to her side and the dog whimpered and cried licking her face returning to the hound Howard had known all it life,1
233,In the morning as the cock crowed the good farmer Howard hitched up their small cart and the good mother Gertrude dressed the girl in a warm fur coat and quilted blanket,1
234,"To every question, was the given the perfect answer",1
235,"Abraham Cornelius Emmanuel’s work in Theology, Biology, and Evolution well",1
236,"The loss of two family members in as many weeks, with a third living member that she had lost long ago, was too much for even me",1
237,"The elderly couples own night was fitful and sleepless as compared to the stray’s, who slept more soundly than a rock",1
238,She responded with a yelp as if she were no more than a whipped dog,1
239,On her slow days she refilled the pen several times,1
240,I was rendered unconscious via the butt of a pistol as I rushed to the library to confront the commotion,1
241,Aligning himself with her path and pointing himself in the direction she had been headed he saw only one light on in the distance,1
242,"Not only had my daughter been kidnaped and murdered, now her body is stolen",1
243,It was not until very late in the day that a question of the force of life and soul came from the attendees,1
244,The farmer Howard later explained that the first contact with her skin had been like trusting his hand into the frozen waters of the Carwell,1
245,"At seventeen and a month she attended her father, me, to the World Scientific Convention",1
246,It was of course stunned silence as she rushed forward and threw her arms about me grasping me close,1
247,The speech had not startled or angered them,1
248,But as they related their story the old matron Gertrude brought the girl forward and peeled the quilt away as if it were a wrapper,1
249,After about an hour she once again attained that far away look in her eye and began softly singing something,1
250,Where it came from he could not say but it had worked its potent stench into the very stone of the hearth,1
251,Howard had not remembered seeing them when he found her as he had been more concerned with a naked girl succumbing to the elements in his field,1
252,"The relief in her queerly matched eyes was apparent immediately, even leaning forward and wrapping her arms about my neck in another hug",1
253,In one year she had easily assimilated all of my research and theories until by the age of fifteen she was starting to provide me with new avenues of thought,1
254,Rumors milled about that Heather was naught but a shell that her father filled with stolen souls of those taken by the plague,1
255,When she had finished and sat the attendees in the room sank into a contemplative silence,1
256,With a flash of brief horror and understanding I remembered,1
257,The only factor holding the constabulary from saying it was my Heather with one-hundred percent certainty was the body’s missing head,1
258,She held her father’s hand as her mother cried inconsolable on her knees,1
259,Faith had been shaken to its very foundation by this wisp of womanhood,1
260,Convinced his search for the ever-elusive soul was growing nearer he had talked about the book in hushed whispers,1
261,Coloring her explanation with examples of her experience and deep knowledge she soon had the room once again captivated in the sound theories and studies of Dr,1
262,He had been out a second day looking for a stray cow that had wandered out of the paddock for the second time in as many days,1
263,"Not as knowledge in human biology as my former partner and her biological father, I was none the less certified to perform most major surgeries if needed; having spent some of my time in the services as a battlefield surgeon",1
264,"I was cheerful and only too curious thinking it at first a child of theirs, perhaps one who was inquiring about a potential job",1
265,"Yet there was no smoke or heat upon entering the room, as if the fire had happened ages ago and now all that was left was a century of ashes and dust",1
266,"Eight years later, a speech unrecorded and filed away only in the minds of those that entertained the farce had resurfaced",1
267,There was something about it that rang with importance,1
268,Abraham Cornelius Emmanuel,2
269,At first Howard believed the dog mad and about to attack the poor helpless girl,1
270,Bound with heavy leather over iron plates riveted to great iron bands that terminated in a piano hinge as thick as my finger at the edge of each cover only to meet in two heavy iron locks upon the breech,1
271,A loud crack of a doorframe being split woke me from my sleep and raised voices guided me downstairs,1
272,"With no Board looking over my shoulder I was of free reign, and found my flights of fancy encouraged",1
273,With the enormous amount of support and care that I showed her she was soon right as spring rain,1
274,"I could not give much of a description besides, three unsavory characters with visages of dockside workers with thick beards dressed in heavy knit",1
275,"Heather I found to be a bright girl, always with a smile, less so bright now that her brother died, but a smile nonetheless",1
276,Heather was lucky to catch a glimpse of him through the keyhole of the dens door,1
277,The girl that was just seventeen was the first to answer among the uncertainty of men,1
278,"She was to lay, as was custom in our family dating back to years of triple digits, upon the slab of marble just inside the doors for three days before cremation",1

284,Hundreds of questions were fielded and the panel returned answers,1
285,"Neighbors of Bernard, after being questioned by me after the fact say there arose such a scream from Bernard’s home that they thought he had found a way into hell itself",1
286,I was moderately wealthy not of least from my inheritance but also from my own research and machination,1
287,Identification was made for certain at the location of a peculiar birthmark upon her shoulder; a set of three freckles in an equilateral triangle,1
288,"About her head was tied a stained dark grey handkerchief, and in her ears wads of cotton",1
289,Ten years go her family had fallen victim to the plague and poverty that seemed to be affecting more people as the days went by,1
290,"I am a genius, let us not forget, my intellect has been tested and thoroughly analyzed by the most elite",1
291,"A few were on their knees praying to their God, or just clutching their head in pain",1
292,But there were those that saw the small but radiant glint in her eye,1
293,Like that of a secret you were unaware you held until the very moment of its betrayal,1

301,The good farmer Howard later recalled he must have been out for nearly an hour and a half trying to calm both the girl and the dog,1
302,"Avenues that were at first mad, then as my comprehension of the solution grew, genius",1
303,I took her in as she seemed alive with questions about my work,1

305,I had no daughter of my own but desperately wanted a child,1
306,After the better part of an hour I had dabbed clean her rough and bruise blotchy face,1
307,To my immediate horror upon laying eyes upon the words scrawled in ink I found it went into detail about each death in his family,1
308,By the time Howard had calmed his wife the girl had turned around and they saw her single visible eye glistening in the lamplight,1
309,Attempting to bring animation back to dead tissue and storage of the soul,1
310,It was not until they were calling upon her to act as a judge on the most renowned panel in the civilized world that it finally struck me how smart she actually was,1
311,A breath that spoke of a relief that had been long and anxiously awaited,1
312,Anyone dressed the way she was in this season should not have lasted more than an hour in the elements before they were no more than a frozen part of the landscape,1
313,Glinting only for a moment in the most hideous fashion she was left standing happy in her own silence and their shock,1

328,Susan was finally brining home enough to live on and Heather’s little brother Maxamilion seemed to be slowly recovering,1
329,He had never been one to carry a tune and was growing hard of hearing in his old age,1

331,"It was not as if she were learning things, but almost as if she were remembering them",1
332,"If only for a moment her innocence was replaced with something more mature, something ancient and primal, something we all contain but least let it venture forth keep it contained",1

337,"After two days of searching they grimly reported back, a body had been found",1

339,From her year of thirteen to fourteen see seem paranoid taking to look over her shoulder every few moments to make sure none stood at her back,1
340,"She stank, in the words of good farmer Howard, ‘she stank of sour milk and garlic having sweated sulfur from her very pores’",1

342,"It seemed an easy life to adjust too, and Heather brightened considerably",1
343,She walked with wide eyes and a contented smile,1

345,A quill pen that made little to no mess and could be taken anywhere and in so creating this simple invention he allowed all of us to do our jobs cleaner and quicker,1
346,In the same instant the dog growled the girl had leapt forward and clung to the dog as if it were the only bit of wood in a vast raging sea,1

357,As Marta returned with the water and gauze I moved my chair forward explaining to Heather what I was to do,1
358,"I was unconvinced of the constable’s conclusion, and felt a more sinister plot behind the brutal theft of her life",1
359,"Her father, even though in the same house with her, rarely came out of his study",1
360,"The speed at which she read frightened me on an intellectual level, she was able to almost fan through the pages of a book to read it in its entirety",1

362,I agreed to stay in the area and serve on the Board but continued my international investments,1
363,"My daughter was dead, I had failed her, my former partner and her father had chosen the wrong man",1

372,A full year and a three quarter departed landing the small city on the front door of winter,1
373,When asked what we understood he just replied with the same,1
374,The large package was dated a day aftermost that of which the Scientific Board voted to have Bernard excommunicated from their ranks,1
375,In one day the temperature dropped ten degrees and the wind died as if a door had been shut,1
376,It sat below and between my land and another farm that bordered the Carwell river,1
377,"Overflowing from drawers, the room looked as if it contained no corners just an array of papery angles ready to give way at the slightest molestation",1
378,They soon left after I assured them that I would go to the police with the story,1
379,Stripping her of the feet and hand bandages the wife had found old thick stitching scars about her ankles and wrists that looked to be still healing,1
380,It was the time of technology and the constabulary’s new fondness for documentation brought about a man with a camera to record all of what they saw,1
381,Twice she had played devil’s advocate to a field Dr,1
382,Explosions containing despair ripped though my mind and body,1
383,I had supplied her with one of the latest dual chamber capillary gravity pens,1
384,Having sent the good farmer Howard to attend to the fire while old Gertrude cleaned the she found she had no one to help her with stripping the girl of her head bandage,1

390,Including his own mad demise and the remission of his daughter to me,1
391,For the span of five minutes after her speech everyone in the room felt a chill run down their spine as they have never felt before,1
392,The doctor that had been called had instantly proclaimed it plague upon seeing these queer welts upon the boy’s neck,1
393,Having a taste of the scientific minds out there and picking the few brains worth her time; Heather was more determined than ever to prove herself a capable scientist,1
394,It took them the better part of an hour to coax her from the corner and back into their favor,1
395,The spine was a quart inch of pitted back iron that held only the hinges and a trio of curious scratches,1
396,A deep crimson silk sash tied in a bow around her neck,1
397,A whimper from Marta behind me was but an understatement to what went through my mind,1
398,Heather knew her name as I spoke it but she remained strangely mute even after her single utterance earlier,1
399,"Abraham Cornelius Emmanuel, it was not odd to receive letters for her pseudonym, that the tension became palpable",1
400,Probably a greeting he concurred,1
401,"What research, what dreams, what madness had drove his pen to paper",1
402,People shunned the street and children called out names to the lonely little girl behind the dirty glass of the home,1

405,"It was not until I informed the Board of my funding change that they practically begged me not to leave, even offering me a seat on their precious board",1
406,"Instead of just dunking the miserable wretch into a tub and scrubbing her until her skin came away the old wife carefully sponged what she could,careful not to disturb the healing scars upon her extremities",1
407,"It was not until dark that he reached his destination, a run down mill upon the Carwell river",1
408,A thirteen year old should never have been submitted to the grotesque admission contained in that letter,1
409,"To his ears had come a man’s voice, no not such a man as we know but a maleness unbecoming of a young woman such as was left sleeping in front of the hearth",1
410,Others laughed it off as a little girl trying to emulate her late father for gain and attention with extreme viewpoints,1
411,For two minutes after the bells struck noon the ground shook and the birds screeched,1
412,I have to admit; I have not seen someone absorb so much knowledge as quickly as she was able,1
413,"The two of us would stand outside his door, me listening to a pen scribble furiously accompanied by muttering and Heather trying desperately to peer through the tiny keyhole",1
414,It was not until her seventeenth birthday when she received a letter for Dr,1
415,For the past year she has gained in so much intelligence that my thoughts when lined up beside hers look as if I were a mongoloid,1
416,To see it with hackles raised and teeth bared was like looking into a face he had never known,1

423,Never having the opportunity to thank me he did so now,1
424,During the years Heather grew in my home I delved deep into my bacterial energy transposition theories often taking wild new roads,1

426,The path ultimately led him directly to my manor on the edge of the city,1
427,At fast as he recoiled he was attempting to calm her and move near her to catch her,1

429,They skipped and played as she strolled down the street to the merchants square,1
430,Only the curious or mad neared the house only to turn away at the rotting wooden gate,1
431,"The case was closed and shelved having no further evidence to work, stamped with an explanation of a robbery kidnaping gone wrong",1
432,"When asked if he could remember any of what she had sung, the farmer replied that it was a blank space inside his mind",1
433,She looked in no pain even as I inspected her stiches and sutures with my own skilled hand,1
434,People began to question what sin this family had committed to have so much negative energy focused upon them,1
435,Some say the tragic incident caused a part of her father to become lodged in the mind of his child,1

437,,26
438,"Perish the thought, had he perpetuated this whole tragedy",1
439,"I have raised her pay enough times to make her the most well paid maid in the city, perhaps one of the most well paid employees in the city",1

444,"When I asked her what details the body of the letter contained on the second page, she simply replied, the future",1
445,What we were to hear from her and find here was simply baffling,1

454,The door we found locked but was soon kicked in by a rather burly constable,1
455,Weather or not they found it I will never know,1
456,To her immediate right and left were two guttering lard candles whose pungent odor was mingling with a strange stink in the air,1
457,But the dog stopped in front of Howard placing itself between her frail form and his squat one,1
458,With times as they were the citizens would have no questions or hesitations when it came to a potential plague victim,1
459,In perfect cheer the girl had been carefully securing the last of the clean bandages to her own head,1
460,The pile of soiled bandages was revealed to contain a mass of dried blood,1
461,Removing the corse thread from her lips and checking her mouth for further damage I watched as she took a deep breath,1
462,Had he known then what was going to happen,1
463,"~@~  ~@~  ~@~
",1
464,"The girl however, seemed to be ignorant of the frigid weather",1
465,"One man, who years later hanged himself when an accident claimed his son, wrote in a paper that, in that span we had all finally ‘understood’",1
466,Shame and depression drove her father deep into his study locking the door for sometimes days on end,1
467,"The Board had heard this theory before, eight years before in fact, and then it had been presented incomplete by an man in his mid forties still unsure about his theorem",1

474,"Inside we found Heather kneeling in the middle of the small room that served as entry, living room and kitchen",1
475,Knowing then what he knew now he stopped her from rushing forward to check on the girl’s condition seeing her in perfect spirits,1
476,It was not until I laid my eyes on that curious birthmark upon her shoulder as the coat was removed and the loose strap of nightgown slipped from her delicate shoulders flashing the blemish,1
477,Set upon a pile of furs they had stacked in front of the fire she lay until the dawn began to peek above the frost,1
478,Looking upon it that day was as if it were a different scene altogether,1
479,"This action, which would have stopped even the most inebriated, was lost upon her",1
480,The feeling became so mutual that she now called me Father instead of Uncle,1
481,I had not but a moment to read the letter before it fell away to dust in my own hands,1
482,It was only then did they hear something from the hearth,1
483,Strays and vermin avoided it as if even they found something sinister about the home,1

491,I’ve never seen a soul outwork that determined Irish lass,1
492,She was not allowed out of the house and the children feared her,1
493,You could always find the capillary pen stabbed into the giant mess of a bun that she kept her hair as if it had grown to be part of her,1
494,Dr,1
495,I had help her set up the privacy net and pseudonym even buying her a small furnished flat inside the middle class quarter that she could claim was her alter ego’s home,1
496,In fact no mortal man should be suffered to know what she only found out,1
497,She now had no one and this people say seemed to hurt her the most,1
498,Unknown to the conservative regressives I had signed research contracts with a joint Japanese and Middle Eastern partners not a week before their demands in anticipation of their very threats,1
499,"Where Bernard had fallen under the ridicule of the Board, I was still highly revered for my work on renewable bacterial induced induction and locomotion",1

507,Howard seeing this immediately turned to his companion of two-score and more years,1
508,On the day after the third week the clouds seemed to gather and congeal into huge formless shapes in the sky,1
